# DNA Sequencing With NLP

### What is DNA Sequencing?
DNA sequencing is a laboratory technique used to determine the exact sequence of bases (A, C, G, and T) in a DNA molecule.DNA sequence information is important to scientists investigating the functions of genes. The technology of DNA sequencing was made faster and less expensive as a part of the Human Genome Project.

### What is Gene?
Genes are a set of instructions that determine what the organism is like, its appearance, how it survives, and how it behaves in its environment.
A gene consists of a long combination of four different nucleotide bases, or chemicals. There are many possible combinations.

### The four nucleotides are:

A (adenine) C (cytosine) G (guanine) T (thymine) Different combinations of the letters ACGT give people different characteristics. For example, a person with the combination ATCGTT may have blue eyes, while somebody with the combination ATCGCT may have brown eyes.

### Project introduction?
In biological computing, working with DNA sequence data is common place. Becomming familiar with the Python package Biopython will really help you when dealing with biological sequence data in Python. DNA sequence data frequently are contained in a file format called "fasta" format.

### What is FASTA formate?
In bioinformatics, FASTA format is a text-based format for representing nucleotide sequences or amino acid (protein) sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes [A,C,G,T,N] where A=Adenosine, C=Cytosine, G=Guanine, T=Thymidine and N= any of A,C,G,T. The format also allows for sequence names and comments to precede the sequences.
